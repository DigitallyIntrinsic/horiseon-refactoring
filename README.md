# Horiseon: Search Engine Optimization at its finest

## Description

This project was created to refactor an existing webpage in order for it to be optimized going forward. 
While we started with the code base already, there was some bloat and redundancies that were isolated and cleaned up in order to have a more streamlined structure.

## Usage

Please peruse the webpage at your leisure, the links on the webpage itself are non-working links
